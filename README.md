# Car-Price-Influencer-Features-ML
To identify the features which influence price of Car in a specific region based on the dataset provided
Here a machine learning model is built to identify the features influencing the price of Car in a particular region based on the dataset provided. This project build an optimal model(neither overfit nor underfit) and identifies the features that can help a new car company to decide on opening its branch in a specific region and choice of car features to increase its sales.
